Rest in Peace, Mr Lee Kuan Yew.
Interview with the New York Times on 13 Sept 2010
"The final verdict will not be in the obituaries. The final verdict will be when the PhD students dig out the archives, read my old papers, assess what my enemies have said, sift the evidence and seek the truth.
I'm not saying that everything I did was right, but everything I did was for an honourable purpose."
